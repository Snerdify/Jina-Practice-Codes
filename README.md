# Jina-Practice-Codes

Jina lets you build multimodal ai services that communicate via gRPC

Jina provides a smooth Pythonic experience for serving ML models transitioning from local deployment to advanced orchestration frameworks like Docker-Compose, Kubernetes, or Jina AI Cloud.

FastAPI communication relies on Pydantic and Jina relies on DocArray allowing Jina to support multiple protocols to expose its services.


Jina provides a smooth transition from local development (using DocArray) to local serving using Deployment and Flow to having production-ready services by using Kubernetes capacity to orchestrate the lifetime of containers.


1. pip install -U jina 
2. Start by building the executor code
Executor allows you to build a fast, scalable , reliable g-RPC based AI service
